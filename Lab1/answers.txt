1.
a. What is the response code you received? [5]
Status code is:  200

b. What is the web server and OS used to host this site? Hint: look at the headers stored in response.headers.items(). [5]
from headers, 'Server' 'Apache/2.4.52 (FreeBSD) OpenSSL/1.1.1d-freebsd PHP/7.4.26'
Server: Apache/2.4.52
OS: FreeBSD

c. What is the size of the response body? [5]
Response body size: 382826 bytes

d. Read the response body into a variable named ‘body’. What is the Python type of the ‘body’ variable? [5]
Type of 'body' variable:  <class 'bytes'>

e. Explain why ‘body’ has that particular type with reference to the structure of HTTP responses. [5]
HTTP response transmit data as raw bytes. so that developers can assign a type. so the body portion of the HTTP response is type byte.

f. What happens if you request the URL “http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/unknown" ? What about  “http://unknown.pdn.ac.lk"? [5]
http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/unknown : 'urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found' - since this is a valid domain, but does not exsist; therefore 404 error.
http://unknown.pdn.ac.lk     : 'urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed>' - url error sice domain is invalid. therefore request fails at DNS resolution stage.

g. Request the following URL and store the response body in a variable ‘body’. https://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D. Try printing the body data. [5]
shows raw bytes and not properly encoded. therefore the response in unreadable. Specially since this contains tamil letters.

h. What difference do you see  if you call the method .decode(“utf-8”) on the body data received in (g) before printing it? [5]
when use correct character encording format(UTF-8) to decode, the response is readable due to propper decording of raw bytes


2.
i. Append the string “&format=json&pretty=1” to the search query. What difference do you see in the response? [5]
without the additonal parameters, the response is raw HTML and not able to read directly
but with the format parameters, it is converted to Json fromat. it is bit easier to read directly.

j. Use request.urlopen to search for the phrase “Rocco's basilisk”. Hint: try it  in your browser first and look at the request URL carefully. [5]
the request URL was     : 'https://www.bing.com/search?q=Rocco%27s+basilisk&FORM=HDRSC1'
Here the search word is encorded as : 'Rocco%27s+basilisk' 

k. What is URL encoding/decoding? Why is it necessary? [5]
URL encording is converting characters into a format that could be safely transmitted.
for example,in previous example the ' symbol was encorded as %27. so that the symbol will not be considered as a part of the command.
URL decording is convertin that encoded format back to normal.

l. How would you do a DDG search in Python for your name written in Tamil or Sinhala? Use this for Unicode input https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/. [5]
first, coppied the name in 'Sinhala' from the given website
then, encorded the string using, 'parse.quote('රවිදු')' and this was encorded as '%E0%B6%BB%E0%B7%80%E0%B7%92%E0%B6%AF%E0%B7%94'
then included that in the URL and send the request.
